    <h1><u>WIMPS</u></h1>
<p>Below is useful information for each service WIMPS may have installed. This is a rough draft and will be expanded in the future</p>
<p>The initial landing page for the webportal can be changed to your liking. There is an example in %homepath%\wimps\installers\webportal\example_landing.html.
This example displayes the jellyfin dashboard in the left, with sonarr and radarr filling out the rest of the page. You can rename example_landing to landing to replace the default page.</p>
    <h2>General Info</h2>
<p><b>There now is a install auto start script that runs to install the below services to the auto start folder (except JFA-GO, use the tray icon to set auto start)</b>.</p>
    <p><u>The below will be removed when re-writing the WIMPS landing page documentation.</u></p>
<p>Some of these services <b>will not auto start on computer boot up</b>; Jellyseerr, Caddy, DuckDNS updater, JFA-GO</p>
<p>You can use EventGhost, if installed with WIMPS, to auto start services on boot.  See below in EventGhost for examples.</p>
<p>You can manually create shortcuts for those services and put them in %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</p>
<p>jellyseerr : %homepath%/wimps/installers/arr_apps/jsrun.bat</p>
<p>Caddy : %homepath%/cadddy/caddyrun.bat</p>
<p>DuckDNS updater : %HOMEPATH%\duckdns\Duckdns.exe</p>
<p>JFA-GO : %HOMEPATH%\jfa</p>
    <h2>iFrame Issues</h2>

    <p>Some services <b>do not load in the webportal iframe</b>, they will open in a new tab or window. If you're having an issue with a service displaying in the iframe see the below service for more details.</p>
   
<p>You can edit portal.html loacated at %homepath%\wimps\installers\webportal\portal.html, and add services to the iframe exempt list, if you prefer that behavior or cant get a service to load in the iframe.<p>At line 110</p>
<blockquote>var iframeExceptions = ['Jellyseerr', 'Threadfin'];</blockquote>

can be expanded to include other services. Such as

<blockquote>var iframeExceptions = ['Jellyseerr', 'Threadfin', 'qBittorrent'];</blockquote>
    <h1><u>qBittorrent</u></h1>
    
      <p>To properly get qBittorrent to display in the iframe</p>
      <p>qBittorrent > tools > options > webui > uncheck clickjacking protection and if using the webportal from a different machine then uncheck Enable Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection</p>
      <p>Change the port to 8081, as that is what the webportal is looking for</p>
    <h1><u>SABNZB</u></h1>
    <p>To get sabnzb to display in the webportal iframe, access the webui in a seperate browser tab or window:</p>
    <p>sabnzb config (gear icon)> special > uncheck x_frame_options</p>
<h1><u>EventGhost</u></h1>
<p>Open EventGhost and in the right hand pane where it says AutoStart :</p>
<p> Right click AutoStart > add action > System > Start Application > locate the .bat or exe </p>
<p>Make sure to set the working directory section to the same directory the .bat or .exe is</p>
    <h1><u>Threadfin</u></h1>
    <p>Basic Threadfin Setup, if you did not restart your computer after WIMPS installed the selected apps, then run as administrator "threadfinrun.bat" located at %homepath%\wimps\m3u\threadfinrun.bat, or run the .exe located at %homepath%\.threadfin\threadfin.exe</p>
    <p>Acess threadfin from the WIMPSPortal or at localhost:34400/web</p>
    <p>Run through the wizard</p>
    <p>Go to settings, at the bottom check the WEB Authentication box, then scroll up and hit save</p>
    <p>Go back to threadfin and create/login</p>
    <p>Go back to settings and scroll down and check all the boxes for m3u/xml/api authentication and save again, set any other settings like refresh interval, PPV Titles option, Tuner connection ammount, etc</p>
    <p>Go to mapping and make sure channels are in the order you want and have epg data from provided xml</p>
    <p>In the "server Information" section (hamberger icon) you will see a url for both the m3u and epg xml. Replace the username and pass with threadfin credentials.</p>
    <p>In Jellyfin under Dashboard> Live TV> add m3u tuner and put in threadfin m3u url, add xmltv data and put in threadfin epg url</p>
    <h1>Jellyfin</h1>
    <p>Run through the jellyfin wizard</p>
    <p>For the creaeted user uncheck "allow auido playback that requires transcoding"</p>
    <p>For the creaeted user uncheck allow Video playback that requires transcoding</p>
<p>Uncheck Force transcoding of remote media sources such as Live TV</p>
    <p>In dashboard>library>set up Movie and TV folder pointed to the location set in WIMPS settings, make sure Real Time Monitoring is enabled</p>
    <p>See threadfin for live tv setup</p>
    <h1><u>JFA-GO</u></h1>
    <p>Run the jfa.exe in %homepath%/jfa</p>
    <p>Run through the setup, and enable auto start with the tray icon</p>
    <h1><u>Reverse Proxy</u></h1>
    <h2>DuckDNS</h2>
    <p>Sign in to DuckDNS and create three domains, one each for; Jellyfin server, Jellyseerr, and JFA-GO</p>
    <p>example</p>
    <p>coolservername.duckdns.org</p>
    <p>coolservernamerequests.duckdns.org</p>
    <p>coolservernamesignup.duckdns.org</p>
    <p>These are the urls to enter in the Caddy/Reverse Proxy settings</p>
    <h2>Caddy Setup</h2>
    <p>If you entered in Caddy information in the settings when first installing then this should be set up</p>
    <p>You can run the settings again and reapply them through the start menu > Wimps > Wimps Settings</p>
    <p>Typical setup reverse proxies Jellyfin, JFA-GO, and Jellyseerr, DO NOT PUT SONARR/RADARR/PROWLARR behind reverse proxy</p>
    <p>When asked for the localip and port the format is 192.x.x.x:xxxx</p>
    <p>Typical Jellyfin server would be 192.168.0.44:8096</p>
    <h1><u>ProtonVPN</u></h1>
    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>Create a profile that connects to a country outside the USA and is set to fastest.</p>
    <p>In proton vpn settings, set that profile as your main, and to connect automatically</p>
    <h2>Split Tunnel</h2>
    <p>In settings, advanced > enable split tunneling > only use vpn for specified app> select Qbittorrent</p>
    <p>In qbittorrent > tools > options > network adapter > ProtonVPN</p>
    <h1><u>Jellyseer</u></h1>
    <p>Use WIMPSPortal to navigate to Jellyseerr, and run through the setup (Jellyfin and *ARR Apps must be set up before this)</p>
    <h1><u>*ARR Apps</u></h1>
    <p>Use the links to the right of the iframe to set up Sonarr, Radarr, and Prowlarr</p>
