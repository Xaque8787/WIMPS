<h1><u>WIMPS</u></h1>
    <p>Below is useful information for each service WIMPS may have installed. This is a rough draft and will be expanded in the future</p>
    <p>The initial landing page for the webportal (currently blank) can be changed to your liking. There is an example at %homepath%\wimps\installers\webportal\example_landing.html.</p>
    <p>This example displayes the jellyfin dashboard in the left, with sonarr and radarr filling out the rest of the page. You can rename "example_landing.html" to "landing.html" to replace the default blank page.</p>
    <p>While WIMPS can be ran on a pre-existing system that is used for other purposes than a media server, the ideal environment is on a clean windows install, that is fully up to date.</p>
    <p>Some windows settings that may be useful</p>
    <p>Set up a password on your current user then, start menu > run > netplwiz > uncheck the box about sign in> enter password. This allows the computer to boot directly to desktop bypassing sign in page.</p>
    <p>Even if you have no password set, on boot you'll need to click to sign in, which is a pain if running headless after initial setup</p>
    <p>You should set up a specific time for windows to update. An early hour such as 6am works well, unless you have users that watch during that hour. Also avoid conflicts with Jellyfin Scheduled Tasks and M3U task scheduler</p>
    <p>You will need to create a scheduled task to download and update your VOD content. See M3U below for setup</p>
    <h2>General Info</h2>
    <p><b>Auto-Start Programs:</b>Some apps, that dont have a start on boot option, have a shortcut created to the startup folder. Included are Caddy(reverse proxy), Jellyseerr, DuckDns, Threadfin. DOES NOT include JFA-GO (see below)</p>
    <p><u><b>Before you run WIMPS and install anything, I would suggest you have these things below setup</b></u><p>
    <p>DuckDNS account with 3 domains created (see below example), and your Duckdns api token</p>
    <p>iptorrents account in donor status with m3u configured with 2 seperate configs, one for Live TV the other one for borth MOVIE and TV SHOW VOD (suggest 'small list' on first set up, then select 'all' after Jellyfin does initial scan, requires refresh of m3uparserrun.bat)</p>
    <p>Your iptorrents cookie/useragent. In a chrome browser sign into iptorrents account. hit 12 and go to network tab, refresh page (f5), find and select main.js or start.js, and in the request header section on the right, scroll down to find cookie:</p>
    <p>-The cookie format should be as it appears but without the space after the ;</p>
    <p>-The useragent should be listed at the end of the request headers tab</p>
    <p>m3u url to both LiveTV and VOD config, and the epg url</p>
    <p>ProtonVPN account if wanting to use with qBittorrent</p>
    <p>Usenet account and usenet indexer if using SABNZB </p>
    <p>Domain name if wanting to redirect duckdns urls, should have signle ssl cert per subdomain, not sure if wildcard subdomain will work.So you could redirect jellyfin.yoursubdomain.com to coolmediaserverr.duckdns.org so users can use a cleaner URL</p>
    <p>OpenSubtitles account to use in Jellyfin, not necessary but nice. May need opensubtitles plugin from github to get the latest merge that allows .strm files to download subs (you're welcome :) )</p>
    
    <h2>iFrame Issues</h2>
    <p>Some services <b>do not load in the webportal iframe</b>, they will open in a new tab or window. If you're having an issue with a service displaying in the iframe see the below service for more details.</p>
    <p>You can edit portal.html loacated at %homepath%\wimps\installers\webportal\portal.html, and add services to the iframe exempt list, if you prefer that behavior or cant get a service to load in the iframe.<p>At line 110</p>
    <blockquote>var iframeExceptions = ['Jellyseerr', 'Threadfin'];</blockquote>

    <p>can be expanded to include other services. Such as</p>

<blockquote>var iframeExceptions = ['Jellyseerr', 'Threadfin', 'qBittorrent'];</blockquote>

<h1><u>M3UParser</u></h1>
    <p>Start menue > type "Task Scheduler"</p>
    <p>Action > create task > </p>
     <p>General TAB> enter a name, change drop down "Configure for:" to Windows10 </p>
     <p>Triggers TAB> new > every day at X hour  </p>
    <p>Actions TAB> New > Browse > %homepath%\m3u\m3uparserrun.bat > Start in %homepath%\m3u\ (do not use %homepath% enter the absolute path, can be found by entering the %homepath%\m3u in file explorer) </p>
    <p>Conditions TAB and Settings TAB> you preference as it may depend on what hardware you're running. Default values should work.</p>
<h1><u>qBittorrent</u></h1>
    <p>To properly get qBittorrent to display in the iframe</p>
    <p>qBittorrent > tools > options > webui > uncheck clickjacking protection and if using the webportal from a different machine then uncheck Enable Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection</p>
    <p>Change the port to 8081, as that is what the webportal is looking for</p>
    <p>If using Proton VPN, set up split tunneling(see below) then apply in qBittorrent by going to qbittorrent > tools > options > network adapter > ProtonVPN</p>
<h1><u>SABNZB</u></h1>
    <p>To get sabnzb to display in the webportal iframe, access the webui in a seperate browser tab or window:</p>
    <p>sabnzb config (gear icon)> special > uncheck x_frame_options</p>
<h1><u>EventGhost</u></h1>
    <p>Open EventGhost and in the right hand pane where it says AutoStart :</p>
    <p> Right click AutoStart > add action > System > Start Application > locate the .bat or exe </p>
    <p>Make sure to set the working directory section to the same directory the .bat or .exe is</p>
<h1><u>Threadfin</u></h1>
    <p>Basic Threadfin Setup, if you did not restart your computer after WIMPS installed the selected apps, then run as administrator "threadfinrun.bat" located at %homepath%\wimps\m3u\threadfinrun.bat, or run the .exe located at %homepath%\.threadfin\threadfin.exe</p>
    <p>Acess threadfin from the WIMPSPortal or at localhost:34400/web</p>
    <p>Run through the wizard</p>
    <p>Go to settings, at the bottom check the WEB Authentication box, then scroll up and hit save</p>
    <p>Go back to threadfin and create/login</p>
    <p>Go back to settings and scroll down and check all the boxes for m3u/xml/api authentication and save again, set any other settings like refresh interval, PPV Titles option, Tuner connection ammount, etc</p>
    <p>Go to mapping and make sure channels are in the order you want and have epg data from provided xml</p>
    <p>In the "server Information" section (hamberger icon) you will see a url for both the m3u and epg xml. Replace the username and pass with threadfin credentials.</p>
    <p>In Jellyfin under Dashboard> Live TV> add m3u tuner and put in threadfin m3u url, add xmltv data and put in threadfin epg url</p>
<h1><u>Jellyfin</u></h1>
    <p>Run through the jellyfin wizard</p>
    <p>For the created user uncheck "allow auido playback that requires transcoding"</p>
    <p>For the created user uncheck allow Video playback that requires transcoding</p>
    <p>Uncheck Force transcoding of remote media sources such as Live TV</p>
    
    <p>On your <b>jellyfin client</b>, if on android TV, you must uncheck the box for LiveTv playback in the settings that has to do with transcoding.</p>
    <p>On your <b>jellyfin client</b>, set the player for media playback(not live tv playback) to always ask. I tend to use Libvlc as my main but its nice to have the option if something doesnt work.</p> 
    <p>The above are generic settings that should work out of the box, if you have the hardware or want to set up transcoding go ahead, this guide will not cover that. I can say it does work well, as I have used a QuadroP400 with great results for both live tv and movies/shows.</p>
    <p>In dashboard>library>set up Movie and TV folder pointed to the location set in WIMPS settings, make sure Real Time Monitoring is enabled</p>
    <p>I personally set up 2 movie libraries and 2 tv show libraries. Movies, Movie Requests, Tv Shows, Show Requests. Request libraries shoukd be created manually where ever youd'd like. Radarr and Sonarr should have these directories set as root</p>
    <p>The Request Libraries are pointed to a seperate set of folders that are not your VOD folder. I use ..\local\localmovie and ..\local\localtv as my root folders for each Radarr and Sonarr. It helps keep requested content seperate from VOD library.</p>
    <p>That way if you have to rebuild your VOD library for whatever reason your downloaded content will remain seperated.</p>
    <p>See threadfin for live tv setup</p>
    <h1><u>JFA-GO</u></h1>
    <p>Run the jfa.exe in %homepath%/jfa</p>
    <p>Run through the setup, and <b>enable auto start with the tray icon</b></p>
    <p>Basic setup does not need to include email service unless you need people to be able to reset their own password</p>
    <p>After wizard, before you make an invite url, go to settings > check advanced > User Profile > Select a jellyfin account to act as a default profile for newly signed up users.</p>
    <p>-make a user in Jellfin and restart JFA-go if you havent created a non admin user yet</p>
<h1><u>Reverse Proxy</u></h1>
    <h2>DuckDNS</h2>
    <p>Sign in to DuckDNS.org and create three domains, one each for; Jellyfin server, Jellyseerr, and JFA-GO</p>
    <p>example, notice NO https://</p>
    <p>coolservername.duckdns.org</p>
    <p>coolservernamerequests.duckdns.org</p>
    <p>coolservernamesignup.duckdns.org</p>
    <p>These are the urls to enter in the Caddy/Reverse Proxy settings</p>
    <p>Double-click the tray icon, and one of your duckdns urls and your api token</p>
    <p>Set update interval to your liking.</p>
    <p>In the settings, add your other two duckdns urls</p>
    <h2>Caddy Setup</h2>
    <p>If you entered in Caddy information in the settings when first installing then this should be set up</p>
    <p>You can run the settings again and re-apply them through the start menu > Wimps > Wimps Settings. THIS WILL REQUIRE ADDING ALL SERVICES AGAIN</p>
    <p>Typical setup reverse proxies Jellyfin, JFA-GO, and Jellyseerr, DO NOT PUT Sonarr/Radarr/Prowlarr behind reverse proxy</p>
    <p>When asked for the localip and port the format is your standard  xx.xx.xx.xx:xxxx</p>
    <p>An example Jellyfin server would be 192.168.0.44:8096</p>
<h1><u>ProtonVPN</u></h1>
    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>Create a profile that connects to a country outside the USA and is set to fastest.</p>
    <p>In proton vpn settings, set that profile as your main, and to connect automatically</p>
    <h2>Split Tunnel</h2>
    <p>In settings, advanced > enable split tunneling > only use vpn for specified app> select Qbittorrent</p>
    <p>In qbittorrent > tools > options > network adapter > ProtonVPN</p>
<h1><u>Jellyseer</u></h1>
    <p>Use WIMPSPortal to navigate to Jellyseerr, and run through the setup (Jellyfin and *ARR Apps must be set up before this)</p>
    <p>Jellyseerr is well documented, use the links on the right to join discord if you dont know how to configure set up.</p>
<h1><u>*ARR Apps</u></h1>
    <p>Use the links to the right of the iframe to set up Sonarr, Radarr, and Prowlarr</p>
    <p>There are too many quality settings and personal decisions to setting up the arr apps, I suggest using the links to figure out your ideal setup</p>
    <p>Too keep things light on my server I use a 720p/1080p mixed profile with a set size limit for my indexers so it grabs the best quality to size that I acceptable.</p>
    <p>Creating a thrid local directory for Anime is a good idea if you're going to make anime requests.</p>
